# Holisticon Archetype

## Introduction
This archetype is intended to bootstrap a new open source project as quickly as possible.
It should get you up and running in minutes and leave you with a project that has the following properties:

*  Simple project layout
*  Release automation to maven repository (pending)
*  Documentation template (pending)
*  CI with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) (pending)
*  Minimal code conventions check with checkstyle (pending)

So basically anything that you would want to start a new endeavor in the open source world.
