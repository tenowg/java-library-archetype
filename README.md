# Holisticon Archetype
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/holisticon/java-library-archetype.png)](https://travis-ci.org/holisticon/java-library-archetype)
## Introduction
This archetype is intended to bootstrap a new open source project as quickly as possible.
It should get you up and running in minutes and leave you with a project that has the following properties:

*  Simple project layout
*  Release automation to the [central sonatype repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/)
*  Documentation template
*  CI with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) (pending)
*  Minimal code conventions check with checkstyle (pending)

So basically anything that you would want to start a new endeavor in the open source world.
